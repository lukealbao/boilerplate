# Boilerplate App

To get started, start adding your handlers in the `handlers/`
directory. Any Sequelize models you need should be installed in
`lib/models/`. The sequelize instance will automatically import all
models in this directory.

## Sharing is Caring

When you've got your app ready to share, edit this README to be
specific to your app. But you probably want your fellows to be aware
that when they clone and start working, the first thing they should do
is run `make init`. This will copy the handy linting git hooks and
install all dependencies in one go.
