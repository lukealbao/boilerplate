# λαlbao Boilerplate

For quickly creating apps built on [restify](http://restify.com/) and
[sequelize](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Originally
created for spinning up new services in a production environment, it
features some opinionated structure to simplify developing in a
multi-configuration environment. It assumes that you want your service
to be testable, inspectable, easily configurable, and able to work
with other services without you helping. Like all boilerplates, it is
based on enlightened laziness.
